MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) is my main computer for app dev, designing, video editing, and everything else.
It's so powerful and really a good foundation to create digital stuff. It will stay with you regardless of how far you wanna go, how crazy you want to expreiment whatever. And bonus: It's portable !

So, I can enjoy coding wherever like at coffee store, hotels, bring back to my hometown and even in nature :D Pretty awesome. It would have not been possible to film coding videos in nature like this, thanks to its high power efficiency

I choose 14-inch because 16-inch is too big for me. I connect it with Asus VG32VQ at home

In fact, I used the Asus G14 Zephyrus for half a year and really loved that laptop, but using a MacBook has made my development work easier compared to using a Windows laptop
