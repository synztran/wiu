You will wonder why is Viper. A mouse have wireless with receiver but don't have bluetooth feels quite inconvenient. Everything will have "Price" of them. Let me show you good point of Viper that's may be make you have more clearly 

First at all, It's only have 54g of weight (without receiver). One of lightest mouse that's I have ever use. Be a Dev, I don'
t use mouse too much, so weight not a highest priority selection. But with less weight will make you have a good experience when using it and absolute it will be good for your wrist bones

Secondary, may not be a strong point make me select Viper. In fact, before I used Viper, I used to use Logitech G903 - one of the best wireless gaming mice in past. G903 still good; I didn't have any complains about that mouse. But i had a issue when using G903 with my macbook. The issue is that I wanna configure an action button on the mouse, but it's only working when device has a software. In a more comprehensible way, I can't configure the action button on the memory of the mouse, as you know when using a mouse instead of trackpack on mac, you need configure a few action for special button like Mission Control (Swipe up with three finger) or App Expose (Swipe down with three finger). I pretty sure without these action, it'll make you very uncomfortable when using a mouse on Mac. There is nothing to complain about or a problem with Viper. I just set up config on windown, and then the configuration on mouse will work on another device.

Third, It's a second hand mouse and only const 50$ quite cheaper than realse price 89.99$ (not include tax), I don't wanna spend too much money for mouse and Viper is the best product for me. With a ambidextrous form factor, have up to 70 hours battery life - maybe more when turn off light. And the most important thing, Viper using Optical switch, so I think i will avoid the situation have double click on Razer mouse

Finally, Viper have a good housing cover with light logo not on top, so you can add skin for theme without worry about make lost light. Sound click isn't too loud. Everything is good for me
